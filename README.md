# Project: Calculator

This is my implementation of the
["Project: Calculator"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)
from the Foundations Course from The Odin Project.

Checkout the [live preview here](https://peter-mowen.github.io/odin-calculator/).

For this project, I implemented a simple online calculator based loosely on the
["Basic Calculator"](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/basic.php)
from Calculator Soup.

I did not implement the extra credit portions of this project. So the following
features are still pending:

- [ ] User can enter floating point numbers
- [ ] User can undo their last input if they clicked the wrong number (either a
      backspace key or a CE key)
- [ ] Keyboard support
- [ ] User can swap the sign of the number (not in the extra credit list, but it
      should be)
